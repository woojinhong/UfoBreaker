Scene Builder emerged as an indispensable asset, allowing me to rapidly construct intricate user interfaces
without the necessity of intricate coding. The outcome was an interface that adroitly merges practical
functionality with aesthetic allure.
Furthermore, my execution significantly profited from the grace of ScalaFX, a specialized language that
harmoniously integrates with JavaFX in the domain of the Scala programming language. This tactical synergy
empowered me to fabricate interactive user interfaces, execute seamless animations, and shape visually dynamic
components with the inherent grace and lucidity of the Scala language. The consequence was an elevated
developmental journey that metamorphosed my foundational code from utilitarian to artistic.
To expedite my advancement further, I seamlessly integrated the Scala Build Tool (SBT) into my procedural
framework. SBT proved itself as an adaptable companion, meticulously managing critical facets of my project,
encompassing tasks like compilation, testing, and management of dependencies. This integration refined my
developmental process, augmenting efficiency and ensuring a methodically organized project architecture.
The culmination of Scene Builder's visual finesse, ScalaFX's expressive potential, and SBT's optimization of
efficiency yielded a Brick Breaker game that encapsulated the intrinsic essence of the original classic while
embracing contemporary methodologies of development. This fusion not only empowered me to engender an
enthralling gaming experience but also furnished invaluable insights into the harmonious collaboration of
cutting-edge tools in the sphere of contemporary software crafting.

|Game Board|

The supplied FXML code illustrates the arrangement of the gaming area in your Brick Breaker application. It
outlines the visual components and their characteristics within this gaming area, like the oval, ball, and
bricks(UFO).
The gamer shifts a PADDLE horizontally to strike a BALLðŸŽ±. The primary goal of the game is to eradicate all the
BRICKS positioned at the upper part of the display by impacting them using the BALL. However, in case the
ball collides with the lower CONTAINMENT, the player is defeated and the game concludes! To emerge
victorious, it is imperative to eliminate all the BRICKS(indicates UFO in the game :)).

|Time Count|

The notion of "elapsed time" is employed to monitor the duration a player has spent engaging in the game. It
gauges the time span between the initiation of the game and occurrences, such as accomplishing the game, or a
distinct move executed by the player. The "elapsed time" attribute introduces an extra facet to the game, enabling
players to vie for swifter achievement times or to assess their advancement.


|Game Reset|

The essential aspect of the gameplay encounter is the "game reset" capability. This empowers players to
commence anew subsequent to finishing a game, encountering defeat. The intent behind the "game reset"
attribute is to restore all variables, positions, and conditions linked to the game to their original states, affording
players a renewed beginning.
